title: About Me
---

I am currently a data scientist with Organizational Solutions at McKinsey & Company.
In August 2015 I received my Ph.D from the Quantitative Psychology program at the
[University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), where I worked with
[Brian Nosek](http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/),
[Sara Rimm-Kaufman](http://curry.virginia.edu/about/directory/sara-e.-rimm-kaufman), and
Timo von Oertzen on projects focusing on quantitative challenges found in applied 
educational research. I also participated in the July 2015 Insight Health
Data Science program in Boston. My interests include statistics, 
data mining/machine learning, education, and open science. If you look around,
you will find some blog posts, publications, and relevant code.
You can also see a copy of my resume [here](../extras/DPM_Resume_07-2015.pdf).

## R Packages

[mleda](https://github.com/dpmartin42/mleda): Contains exploratory 
plotting and model validation functions to assist applied educational researchers in the analysis 
of two-level multilevel models.

[IAT](https://github.com/dpmartin42/IAT): Contains a dplyr implementation
of the D-Score algorithm for the Implicit Association Test, as well as plotting functions
to visualize the raw data from these tests.

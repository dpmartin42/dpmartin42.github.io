title: About Me
---

I am currently a lead data scientist for the client-facing people analytics team at
McKinsey & Company, where I help clients use data to improve decision-making around talent
related questions. Before this, I received my Ph.D in 2015 from the Quantitative Psychology 
program at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), where I worked with
[Brian Nosek](http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/),
[Sara Rimm-Kaufman](http://curry.virginia.edu/about/directory/sara-e.-rimm-kaufman), and
Timo von Oertzen on projects focusing on quantitative challenges found in applied 
educational research. I also participated in the July 2015 Insight Health
Data Science program in Boston. My interests include statistics, machine learning, 
education, and open science. If you look around,
you will find some blog posts, publications, and relevant code.
You can also see a copy of my resume [here](../extras/DPM_Resume.pdf).

## R Packages

[IAT](https://github.com/dpmartin42/IAT): Contains a dplyr implementation
of the D-Score algorithm for the Implicit Association Test, as well as plotting functions
to visualize the raw data from these tests.
